  - Streamlit (web framework)
  - pandas (CSV parsing and data manipulation)
  - sqlite3 (database - built into Python)
  - plotly (data visualization)
  - pytest (testing framework)
- [x] Verify all dependencies install correctly
- [x] Test basic imports work

## Dependencies
None - this is a foundation ticket

## Notes
- Use Streamlit as the web framework per spec preferences
- Pin specific versions to ensure reproducible builds
- Include development dependencies for testing
