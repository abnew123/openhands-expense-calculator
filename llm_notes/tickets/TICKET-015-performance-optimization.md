# TICKET-015: Performance Optimizations and Large Dataset Handling

## Status: COMPLETED âœ…

## Description
Optimize application performance for handling large datasets (1000+ transactions) and improve overall responsiveness of the user interface.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [x] Implement database query optimizations with proper indexing
- [x] Add pagination and lazy loading for large transaction lists
- [x] Optimize chart rendering for large datasets
- [x] Implement caching for expensive operations
- [x] Add progress indicators for long-running operations
- [x] Optimize memory usage for large CSV imports
- [x] Add database connection pooling if needed
- [x] Implement efficient filtering and search algorithms
- [x] Add performance monitoring and logging

## Dependencies
- TICKET-003 (Database operations)
- TICKET-007 (Transaction display)
- TICKET-010 (Data visualization)

## Estimated Effort
Medium (4-6 hours)

## Notes
- Focus on operations that become slow with 1000+ transactions
- Consider using database views for complex queries
- Implement client-side caching where appropriate
- Add performance metrics to identify bottlenecks
- Ensure UI remains responsive during heavy operations
