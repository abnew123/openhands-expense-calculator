# TICKET-012: Docker Containerization

## Status: TODO

## Description
Create a Dockerfile that can build and run the expense tracker application in a container.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Create Dockerfile with Python base image
- [ ] Install all dependencies from requirements.txt
- [ ] Configure proper working directory and file permissions
- [ ] Expose correct port for Streamlit application
- [ ] Ensure SQLite database persists with volume mounting
- [ ] Add health check for container monitoring
- [ ] Optimize image size and build time
- [ ] Test container builds and runs successfully
- [ ] Document container usage in README

## Dependencies
- TICKET-001 (Requirements.txt)
- TICKET-005 (Working Streamlit app)

## Estimated Effort
Small (2-3 hours)

## Notes
- Use multi-stage build if beneficial for size optimization
- Ensure container runs with non-root user for security
- Configure Streamlit to accept external connections
- Consider using .dockerignore to exclude unnecessary files
